  "summary": "SpotTarget introduces a novel link prediction method that rethinks the effect of target edges in graph neural networks. The method focuses on the impact of excluding training target edges during training. Evaluation on datasets like Ogbl-Collab and Ogbl-Citation2 shows that low-degree nodes experience higher relative degree changes when target edges are excluded. The approach achieves competitive performance in link prediction tasks while addressing data leakage concerns.",
