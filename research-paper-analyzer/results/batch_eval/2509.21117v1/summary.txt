TrustJudge addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, specifically Score-Comparison and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistencies. It introduces a probabilistic framework with distribution-sensitive scoring and likelihood-aware aggregation. Evaluated using Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher accuracy. The framework improves reliability without requiring additional training or human annotations.
