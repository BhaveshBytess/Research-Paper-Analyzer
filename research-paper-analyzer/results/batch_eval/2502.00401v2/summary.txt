We propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP), a novel graph representation learning framework that integrates spectral and curvature insights. CUSP introduces three key components: Cusp Laplacian, Cusp Filtering, and Cusp Pooling, enabling optimization of node embeddings in mixed-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, Euclidean). Evaluated on eight datasets, CUSP achieves up to 5.3% improvement in node classification and link prediction tasks over state-of-the-art models. The method leverages Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Riemannian graph filters to enhance representation learning for complex graph structures.
