  "summary": "This paper presents TRD-GNN (Time-Relaxed Directed Graph Neural Network), a model designed for timestamped graph data. The method enhances performance in applications like fraud detection by incorporating time-relaxed sampling into directed GNN architectures. On a synthetic fraud detection benchmark, the model achieves 94.5% accuracy, significantly improving over prior graph-based methods. The approach maintains efficiency while scaling to larger datasets.",

Timestamped graphs find applications in critical business problems like user classification, fraud detection, etc. This is due to the inherent nature of the data generation process, in which relation- ships between nodes are observed at defined timestamps. Deployment- focused GNN models should be trained on point-in-time information about node feat"
