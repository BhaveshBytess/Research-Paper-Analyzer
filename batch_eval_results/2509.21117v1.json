  "summary": "We introduce TRUSTJUDGE, a framework addressing inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. By introducing a novel cyclic invariance principle, it ensures that evaluation scores remain consistent across swapped query orders, i.e., the score for 'Rx ≻ Ry' under one ordering equals the score for 'Ry ≻ Rx' under the reversed order. This is formally proven as m(1; Rx, Ry) = m(-1; Ry, Rx), and similarly for other cases, leading to the conclusion that the estimated comparative bias (CB) satisfies CB(Rx, Ry) = -CB(Ry, Rx). The method is validated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
